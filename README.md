# Face Blindness

## Setup

### MacOS/Linux

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Open another terminal window; from there, `npm run seed` to seed the database

## Why?
Because I was bored and it was decent react practice. I'm really bad with learning names and this didn't do anything to help that. Was kinda fun to make though.
